layout items:
* looks like you've got a bunch of individual ground traces left over from before you added zones for it 
* did you really want 1.0mm pitch headers for the right side?  those only leave 0.15mm between the pads, and JLC's capabilities say 0.2mm.
* I'd probably have done GND on one side and +3.3V on the other, so you can just drop vias down instead of snaking a 3.3V trace all the way across the board.
* internal acute angles are traditionally frowned-upon, but probably fine for now.  they used to catch the etchant and not completely get rinsed off but that's less of a problem now I think.
* holy crap the 1N5820 is a chonky diode

I think SMD is great, but if I'm going to solder it I want through pin. Always fun to solder an smd mount part with the shakes.

get some solder paste and a hot air reflow station and it feels like cheating
